# customer-feedback-robot

This file contains the code and TinkerCad schematics for the feedback robot,  
the need for this robot arised as a precaution to COVID-19, since pushing a button to give feedback on the service is not sanitary.  

The project is comprised of an arduino controlling 6 servo motors which will act as the robot arms,  
and an ultrasonic sensor to detect a person standing in front of the robot,  
this will activate a welcome gesture and will send a signal to the tablet attached to play a video, in order to get the feedback from facial expressions.
